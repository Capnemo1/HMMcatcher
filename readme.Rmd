# üß¨ HMMcatcher (Beta)

**HMMcatcher** is a Streamlit-based bioinformatics tool for building and searching profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from protein sequences.  
It automates the workflow from multiple sequence alignment to HMM-based search and Pfam domain validation ‚Äî designed for researchers studying transcription factors, enzymes, or any protein family with conserved domains.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Multiple sequence alignment using **Clustal Omega**.  
- Profile HMM construction with **HMMER (hmmbuild)**.  
- Homolog search using **hmmsearch** with adjustable E-value thresholds.  
- Sequence extraction and filtering via **Biopython**.  
- Domain validation using **hmmscan** against Pfam.  
- Fully interactive interface built with **Streamlit**, including file upload and result downloads.

## üß† Applications

**HMMcatcher** can be used for:

- Identification of **transcription factors** (e.g., WRKY, NAC, MYB).  
- Comparative **protein family analysis**.  
- **Functional annotation** and homolog discovery.  
- **Curation of proteomes** before phylogenetic or expression studies.

## üöÄ Deployment

**HMMcatcher** runs directly in your browser through [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

To deploy or test locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
