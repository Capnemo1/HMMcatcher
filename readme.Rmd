**HMMcatcher** is a lightweight **Streamlit-based bioinformatics tool** for building and searching profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from protein sequences.  
It automates the entire workflow — from multiple sequence alignment to HMM-based homolog search and optional Pfam domain validation.  
Designed for researchers studying **transcription factors, enzymes, or any conserved protein family**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 🔹 Multiple sequence alignment using **Clustal Omega**  
- 🔹 Profile HMM construction with **HMMER (hmmbuild)**  
- 🔹 Homolog search using **hmmsearch** (adjustable *E-value*)  
- 🔹 Sequence extraction and filtering via **Biopython**  
- 🔹 (Optional) Domain validation using **hmmscan** against Pfam  
- 🔹 Fully interactive interface built with **Streamlit**  
- 🔹 Results available for download in standard formats (`.sto`, `.hmm`, `.tsv`, `.fasta`)

## 🧠 Applications

**HMMcatcher** can be used for:

- 🧩 Identification of **transcription factors** (e.g., WRKY, NAC, MYB)  
- 🧬 Comparative **protein family analysis**  
- 📊 **Functional annotation** and homolog discovery  
- 🧫 **Curation of proteomes** before phylogenetic or expression studies
